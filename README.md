# TRE-IA
Timed-Release Encryption with Implicit Authentication
This repository was created for the camera-ready version of our TRE-IA scheme.
During blind submission this was not available for our peer reviewers to ensure the anonomity of the authors. 

Thank you for reviewing the implementation of our scheme.

Please note on TREIA.py that we have done the implementation with both textbook RSA and RSA-OEAP to show that the encryption and decryption operations work properly for either case. 

To add delay increase the variable t on line 109.
